# Harmonic_Rain

These animations were built as demos for my Fall 2018 first year Vibrations and Waves lectures at the University of Bath. (You may need to adjust the location of your ffmpeg executable)

Harmonic_Rain.ipynb:
This is just a quick matplotlib demo for animating fill_between plots demonstrating Fourier synthesis of a square wave.
It generates harmonic_rain.mp4

Instrument_Harmonics.ipynb:
This is a demo for Fourier spectral analysis of different instrument recordings, including the audio from the recordings. It is meant to be used with a worksheet/course notes.
It generates spec_analysis_audio.mp4
